## Note

This is a frontend demo only. In a real application, you would need to implement backend functionality with a database to store user data, posts, etc.

For the demo, all data is stored in JavaScript arrays and is reset when the page is refreshed.

## Image Credits

For the demo, you should use placeholder images. You can generate these from sites like:
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for post images
- [UI Faces](https://uifaces.co/) for user profile pictures
